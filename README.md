## Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.

Implementing a data access layer of an application has been cumbersome for quite a while. Too much boilerplate code has to be written to execute simple queries as well as perform pagination, and auditing. Spring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount thatâ€™s actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.

## HTTP Request Methods
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

### GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
### POST
The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
### PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
### DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

## Exception Handling in Java
The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
